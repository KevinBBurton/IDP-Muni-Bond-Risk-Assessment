10026 00008 je115v43em               ospi is directed to convene a financial oversight committee (“oversight committee”) if a district is found to be financially insolvent or at the request of a financially insolvent district.  the purpose of the oversight committee is to review the financial condition of a financially insolvent school district, hold a public hearing, and make a recommendation to ospi as to whether the district should be dissolved or placed under enhanced financial monitoring.  ospi may file a petition with the appropriate regional committee to d issolve a financially insolvent school district if recommended by the oversight committee.  the petition must specify the proposed annexation of the financially insolvent school district by one or more contiguous school districts and the disposition of ass ets and liabilities of the financially insolvent school district.  the esd negotiates with the identified contiguous school districts and attempts to seek agreement regarding annexation of the financially insolvent school district.  before the effective date of dissolution, a school district that annexes part or all of a financially insolvent school district may submit to the voters either a levy to replace existing levies and provide for an increase due to the dissolution, or an additional levy to provide for an increase due to the dissolution.  a financially insolvent school district may file for bankruptcy only if recommended by the oversight committee.  municipal bankruptcies under current washington law, local governments, such as the district, may be able to file for bankruptcy under chapter 9 of the united states bankruptcy code (the “bankruptcy code”).  a creditor, however, cannot bring an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding against a municipality, including the district.  the fede ral bankruptcy courts have broad discretionary powers under the bankruptcy code.  if the district were to become a debtor in a federal bankruptcy case, owners of the bonds may not be able to exercise any of their remedies under the bond resolution during the course of a proceeding.  the district is authorized by law to provide for the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds by annual levies of the voter-approved excess property tax, but the statute does not characterize the nature of such payment obligation in the event of a district bankruptcy.”  to the extent that excess property tax levies collected solely for the purpose of paying debt service on unlimited tax general obligation bonds, such as the bonds, are considered “special revenues” under the bankruptcy code, then such excess property tax levies may be afforded certain protections in a bankruptcy proceeding.  there is no assurance, however, that a court would hold that such excess property tax levies are “special revenues” for purposes of the bankruptcy code.    seismic risks
 
seismic safety project.   on june 30, 2021, sssp released a report that summarized the seismic risk at 561 school buildings across the state.  the report further stated that the median building from the study was expected to incur 55 percent damage in a design-level earthquake, and that half the buildings studied would not thereafter be repairable and would require demolition.  in addition, the report ranked the buildings for seismic retrofit priority based on relative risk.  lastly, the report provided recommendations and suggested further studies to, among
