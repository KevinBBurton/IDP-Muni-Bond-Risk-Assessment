  it sho uld thus be noted that the 
pledge of the faith and c redit of a political subdivisi on in the state is a pledge of an  issuer of a genera l obligation  
bond o r note to use its general r evenue  powers, i ncluding, but not  limite d to, its  property tax levy, to pay debt 
service on such obligations, but that such  pledge may or may not be interpret ed by a court of competent 
jurisd iction to include a  constitutio nal or statutory lien upon any par ticula r revenues .  chapter ix permits an y political subdivi sion, public  agency  or 
instrumentality that is insol vent or una ble to meet its debts ( i) to fil e a p etition in a court of bankruptcy for the 
purpose of effe cting a plan to ad just its debts provided such en tity is authorized to do so by a pplicable state law ; 
(ii) direc ts such  a petitioner to file with t he co urt a list of a petitioner’ s credi tors; (ii i) provides that a petition  
filed under such chapter shall op erate as a st ay of  the commencement or continuati on of  any judicial or other 
proceeding against the petitioner; (iv) grants priority to debt owed f or se rvices or m aterial actually  provid ed 
within  three (3) m onths of the fi ling of the petition; (v)  directs a petitioner to file a plan for the adjustment of  its 
debts; and  (vi)  provides t hat the plan must b e accepted i n writi ng by or on behalf of credit ors h olding at l east 
two-thirds (2/3) i n amount or mo re than one-half (1/2)  in number of the listed creditors . 
 
bankruptcy  proceedings by the village  could ha ve ad verse effects on holders of  bonds or notes inc luding (a) 
delay in  the enforcement of their re medie s, (b) subo rdination of the ir clai ms to tho se su pplying  goods and 
services to the village  after the init iation of ban krupt cy proceedings and to the admin istrative expenses of 
bankruptcy  proceedings and (c ) imposition  withou t their consent of a reorgan ization plan red ucing or delayin g 
payme nt of the  note s.  the bankruptcy cod e contains provisions intended to ensure that, in an y reorganization 
plan not accep ted b y at least a majority of a class of creditors such as the holders  of general obligation bonds , 
such creditors  will have the b enefit of their origi nal claim or the “indu bitable equivalent”.  the effect o f these 
and o ther provisions of the bankruptcy co de ca nnot be predicted and may b e significantly aff ected by jud icial 
interpretation.  
 
accordingly,  enforceability of the rights an d remed ies of th e own ers of the notes, and the obligations incurred 
by the village , may be come subject to chapter ix and appli cable  bankruptcy, insolvency, re organization, 
morat orium, or si milar l aws relating to or affecting  the enforcement  of creditor’s r ights g enerally,  now or 6 
 hereafter in effect , equity principles which may limi t the specifi c enf orcement under state law of cer tain 
remedies, the exercise by t he united states of  ame rica of the pow ers delegated to it by the c onsti tution, the  
reasonable and necessa ry exerci se, i n certa in exceptional situations, of the police powers i nherent in th e 
sovereignty of the state and its g overn mental bodies in the intere st of serving a sig nificant and  legiti mate public 
purpose and the limit ations on r emedies against public agencies in th e state .  bankruptcy p roceedings, or the 
exercise of pow ers by the fe deral  or state government, if initia ted, could subject the owners of  the notes to 
judic ial discreti on, int erpretation and of their rig hts in bankruptc y or otherwise, and con sequently  may entail 
risks of delay,  limitation, or modification of th eir rights. 
 
the above  references to the bankruptc y act a re not to b e construed as  an indic ation t hat the village is currentl y 
considering or expects to resort t o the provi sions  of the bankruptcy act.  school districts and fire dist ricts are not e ligible for frb assistanc e. 
 
 
risk fa ctors  
 
there ar e certain potential risks associated with an in vestm ent in the the notes, and investors s hould be 
thoroughly familiar with this offici al statemen t, inclu ding its append ices, in ord er to mak e an informed 
inves tment decis ion. investors should consider, in pa rticular, the following factors:  
 
the village ’s credit rating cou ld be affected by circumsta nces beyond the village ’s control.  the market value o f the  notes is depe ndent upo n the abi lity of holder to 
potentiall y incur a  capital loss if such notes are sol d prior to their maturity.  
 
ther e can be no assurance that adverse events inclu ding,  for example, th e seeking by ano ther mu nicip ality in  the 
state or elsewhere of re medies pursuant to the federal  bankruptcy act or otherwise, will not occur which  might 
affect the mar ket price of and the m arket for the notes. length: 4882
