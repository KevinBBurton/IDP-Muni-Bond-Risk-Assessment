cyber-security 
computer networks and data transmission and collection are vital to the operations of the county.  despite security 
measures, information technology and infrastructure of the county may be vulnerable to attacks by outside or internal 
hackers, or breached by employee error, negligence or malfeasance.  any such disruption or other loss of information could result in a disruption in the 
operation of the county and could adversely affect the ability of the county to timely collect and disburse ad valorem 
taxes.
in an effort to mitigate cyber security threats, the county has implemented a spam filtering service, has upgraded its 
enterprise agreement to a government plan with end to end encryption on email and conducts regular cyber-security 
awareness training for its employees. this training is essential to reduce the risk that the organization’s employees can be 
tricked by sophisticated phishing or social engineering methods into serving unknowingly as entry points into the 
organization’s information and data systems.  the county also maintains cyber security insurance to help mitigate cyber 
security risk.
