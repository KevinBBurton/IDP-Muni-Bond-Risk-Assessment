risk factors 
 
there are certain potential risks associated with an investment in the notes, and investors should be thoroughly 
familiar with this official statement, including its appendices, in order to make an informed investment decision. 
investors should consider, in particular, the following factors:  
 
the district's credit rating could be affected by circumstances beyond the district's control. if interest rates 
should increase, the price of a bond or note may decline causing the bond or noteholder to potentially incur a capital 
loss if such bond or note is sold prior to its maturity.  
 
the financial condition of the district as well as the market for the notes could be affected by a variety of factors, 
some of which are beyond the districtâ€™s control. there can be no assurance that adverse events in the state, 
including, for example, the seeking by a municipality of remedies pursuant to the federal bankruptcy act or 
otherwise, will not occur which might affect the market price of and the market for the notes.  
 
 
cybersecurity 
 
the district, like many other public and private entities, relies on technology to conduct its operations. as a 
recipient and provider of personal, private, or sensitive information, the district faces multiple cyber threats 
including, but not limited to, hacking, viruses, malware and other attacks on computer and other sensitive digital 
networks and systems. to mitigate the risk of business operations impact and/or damage from cyber incidents or 
cyber-attacks, the district invests in various forms of cybersecurity and operational controls; however, no assurances 
can be given that such security and operational control measures will be completely successful to guard against 
cyber threats and attacks. length: 1828
