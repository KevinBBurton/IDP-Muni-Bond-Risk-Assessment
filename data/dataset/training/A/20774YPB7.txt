  failure to comply with applicable licensure and certification requirements could result in denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, tempor ary suspension of admission of new patients, denial of medicare payment for new admissions and in extr eme circumstances, loss of license or suspension from the medicare/medicaid programs. other risk factors  in the future, the following additional factors,  among others, may adversely affect the operations of health care providers or of tax exempt non-profit entities, including the institution, to an extent that cannot be determined at this time: • employee strikes and other adverse labor actions by unionized labor or by other employees, which could result in a substantial reduction in revenues without corresponding decreases in costs from current levels. • reduced demand for the services of the obligated group, which might result from decreases, if any, in the population of the obligated group’s service area. • the occurrence of natural disasters, including floods and earthquakes, which may damage the facilities of the obligated group, interrupt utility service to the facilities, or otherwise impair the operation of the obligated group and the generation of revenues from the facilities. • loss of approved status for or failure by the institution to maintain residency programs and teaching affiliations.  • reduced utilization of institution facilities as a result of other factors, including trends in physician practices toward fewer inpatient admissions, shorter lengths of stay for admitted patients and increased outpatient surgery at ambulatory care facilities. general considerations  limitations on effectiveness of pledge of gross receipts under the loan agreement 
 
 the effectiveness of the security interest in gross receipts granted pursuant to the loan agreement may be limited by a number of factors, in cluding: (i) provisions prohibiting the direct payment of amounts due to health care providers from medicaid and medicare programs to persons other than such providers; (ii) the absence of an express provision permitting assignment of receivables due under contracts with third-party payors, and present or fu ture prohibitions against assignment contained in any applicable statutes or regulations; (iii) certain judicial decisions which cast doubt upon the right of the trustee, in the event of the bankruptcy of a memb er of the obligated group, to collect and retain accounts receivable due such member from medicare, medicaid and other governmental programs; (iv) statutory liens; (v) rights arising in favor of th e united states of america or any agency thereof; (vi) constructive trusts, equitable or other rights impressed or conferred by a federal or state court in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction; and (vii) claims that might arise if appropriate financing or continuation statements are not filed in accordance with the connecticut uniform commercial code as from time to time in effect.   in addition, the effectiveness of the security interest granted in the gross receipts of each member of the obligated group may be limited if th e proceeds thereof are commingled with other moneys of such member not subject to such security interest and if the trustee does not take possession of any cash (or other items as to which possession is required for perfection of a security interest) constituting gross receipts or the proceeds thereof.   in the event of the bankruptcy of any member  of the obligated group, pursuant to the federal bankruptcy code, any receivables coming into existen ce and any gross receipts received on or after the date which is 90 days (or, in some circumstances, one  year) prior to the commencement of proceedings in the bankruptcy court may no longer be subject to the lien granted to secure the series b note and, with respect to the gross receipts, the interest of the tr ustee holding the series b note for the benefit of the bondowners would be shared with general creditors of such member of the obligated group.  under certain circumstances, a bankruptcy court or a court of equity may have the power to direct the use of gross receipts to meet expenses of the bankrupt ent ity before paying debt service on the series b note.  enforceability of lien on gross receipts in the event of bankruptcy  the loan agreement provides that the obligated group shall make payments to the authority sufficient to pay the series b bonds and the interest thereon as the same become due.  in  the event of bankruptcy of any of the obligated group members, pursuant to the federal bankruptcy code, any receivables coming into existence and any gross receipts received on or after the date which is 90 days (or, in some circumstances, one year) prior to the commencement of the case in bankruptcy c ourt might not be subject to the lien of the trustee and under certain circumstances a bankruptcy court may have power to direct the use of gross receipts to meet expenses of the obligated group before paying debt service on the series b note.  with respect to gross receipts not subject to the lien, because of  the bankruptcy protection laws, the trustee would occupy the position of an unsecured creditor.  the obligated group’s funding policy with respect to the defined benefit plan is to contribute amounts sufficient to cover benefits to be  paid as required by employee retirement income security act funding standards. length: 5452
