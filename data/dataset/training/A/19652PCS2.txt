investment considerations
general
there are a number of factors affecting institutions of higher education in general, including the
university, that could have an adverse effect on the university’s financial position and its ability to make
the payments required under the bond resolution. these factors include, but are not limited to, the
continuing rising costs of providing higher education services; competition for students from other
institutions of higher education; the failure to maintain or increase in the future the funds obtained by the
university from other sources, including gifts and contributions from donors, grants, or appropriations
from governmental bodies and income from investment of endowment funds and operating funds; adverse
results from the investment of endowment funds and operating funds; increasing costs of compliance with
federal or state laws or regulations, including, without limitation, laws or regulations concerning
environmental quality, work safety and accommodating the disabled; changes in federal governmental
policy relating to the reimbursement of overhead costs of government contracts; any unionization of the
university’s work force with consequent impact on wage scales and operating costs of the university; and
legislation or regulations which may affect student aid and other program funding. the university cannot
assess or predict the ultimate effect of these factors on its operations or financial results. see generally “security and sources of
payment for the series 2013 bonds.see “security and sources of payment for the series

facilities at competitive rates may have an adverse impact on the level of utilization of the auxiliary
facilities system and on the ability of the board to adjust fees and rates in the future. for further information on the reduction, see
