 25 bankruptcy limitation to registered owners' rights   the enforceability of the rights and remedies of registered owners may be limited by laws relating to bankruptcy, reorganizat ion or other similar laws of general application affecting the rights of creditors of political subdivisions such as the district.  subject to the requirements of state law discussed below, a political subdivision such as the district may voluntarily file a petition for relief from creditors under  chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy code, 11 usc sections 901-946.  the automatic stay wo uld remain in effect until the federal bankruptcy judge hearing the case dismissed the petition, enters an order granting relief from the stay or otherwise allows creditors to proceed against the petitioning political subdivision.  a political subdivision, such as the district, may qualify as a debtor eligible to proceed in a chapter 9 case only if it (i) is specifically authorized to file for federal bankruptcy protection by applicable state law, (ii) is insolvent or unable to meet its debts as they mature, (iii) desires to effect a plan to adjust such debts, and (iv) has either obtained the agreement of or negotiated in good faith with its creditors or is unable to negotiate with its creditors because negotiations are impracticable.  under sta te law a municipal utility district, such as the district, must obtain the approval of the tceq as a condition to seeking relief under the federal bankruptcy code.  the tceq is required to investigate the financial condition of a financially troubled district and authorize such district to pro ceed under federal bankruptcy law only if such district has fully exercised its rights and powers under state law and remains unable to meet its debts  and other obligations as they mature.  notwithstanding noncompliance by a district with state law requirements, a district could f ile a voluntary bankruptcy petition under chapter 9, thereby involving the protection of the automatic stay until the bankruptcy court, after a hearing, dismisses the petition.  a federal bankruptcy court is a court of equity and federal bankruptcy judges have considerable discretion in the conduct of bankruptcy proceedings and in making the decision of whether to grant the petitioning district relief from its creditors.  while such a decision might be applicable, the concomitant delay and loss of remedies to the registered owners could potentially and adversely impair the value of the registered owner's claim.   if a petitioning district were allowed to proceed voluntarily under chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy code, it could file a  plan for an adjustment of its debts.  if such a plan were confirmed by the bankruptcy court, it could, among other things, affect a registered owner  by reducing or eliminating the amount of indebtedness, deferring or rearranging the debt service schedule, reducing or eliminating the interest rate, modifying or abrogating collateral or security arrangements, substituting (in whole or in part) other securities, and otherwise compromising and modifying the rights and remedies of the registered owner's claim against a district.   a district may not be forced into bankruptcy involuntarily.   the effect of the financial institutions act of 1989 on tax collections of the district  the "financial institutions reform, recovery and enforcement act of 1989" ("firrea"), enacted on august 9, 1989, contains certain provisions which affect the time for protesting property valuations, the fixing of tax liens, and the collection of penalties and interest on delinquent taxes on real property owned by the federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic") when the fdic is acting as the conservator or receiver of an insolvent financial institution.   neither the tceq nor the attorney general of texas passes upon or guarantees the security of the bonds as an investment, nor have the foregoing authorities passed
