 economic and other factors 
future economic and other factors may adversely affect the school’s revenues and expenses and, consequently, the school’s ability to make payments  under the sublease agreement.  among the factors that could have such adverse effects are:  decreases in the number of students seeking to attend the school at optimum levels for each grade level; the ability of  the school to provide the education desired and accepted by the population served; economic developm ents in the affected service area, including inflation and interest rates; diminution of the school's reputation; competition from other educational institutions, including other charter schools, private schools and public schools; lessened ability of the school to attract and retain qualified teachers and sta ff at forecasted salaries; increased costs associated with technological advances; changes in government regulation of the education industry or in the new jersey charter school statutes; decrease in per-student funding amounts by the state; future claims and torts (for accidents of any other reason) at the school  and the extent of insurance coverage for such claims; and the occurrence of natural disasters, such as floods. competition for students 
the school competes for students with other public  schools, charter schools and private schools.  see appendix a-1 - “enrollment - service area and competing schools”, for information regarding other schools in the school’s service area.   
 
factors associated with education 
there are a number of factors affecting schools in general, including the school, that could have an adverse effect on the school’s financial position and ability to make the payments required under the sublease agreement.  these factors include, but are not limited to, increasing costs of compliance with federal or state regulatory laws or regulations, including, without limitation, laws or regulations concerning environmental quality, work safety and accommodation of persons with disabilities; any unionization of the school's workforce with consequent  impact on wage scales and operating costs of the school; changes in existing statutes pertaining to the powers of the school; decline of the school’s reputation, the faculty or student body, either ge nerally or with respect to certain academic or extracurricular areas; and the disruption of the school’s operations by real or perceived threats against the school, the employees or the students.  the school cannot assess or predict the ultimate effect of these factors on its operations or financial results of its operations.  loss of such key trustees/managers, and the inability of the school to find comparable qualified replacements, c ould adversely affect any of the school’s operations or financial results.  risks of real estate investment 
general.  development and operation of real estate, such as the project facilities, involves certain 
risks, including the risk of adverse changes in  general economic and local conditions, including population decreases; uninsured losses; lack of attractiv eness of the property to students/parents; cyclical nature of the real estate market; adverse changes in neighborhood values; and adverse changes in zoning laws, other laws and regulations and real property tax rates (to the extent such taxes are applicable to the project facilities).  such losses also include the possib ility of fire or other casualty or condemnation.  although the school will be required to obtain certain 
insurance against damage or destruction as set forth in the loan agreement and the mortgage, there can be no assurance that any portion of the project facilities will not suffer losses for which insurance cannot be or has not been obtained or that the amount of any such loss, or the period during which the school, as a result of damage or destruction to the project facilities, cannot generate revenues, will not exceed the coverage of such insurance policies. construction risk.  the construction, renovatio n and improvement, as applicable, of the 
renovations to the project facilities is subject to the ri sk of delays due to a variety of factors including, among others, delays in obtaining the necessary permits,  licenses and other governmental approvals, site difficulties, labor disputes, delays in delivery and shor tage of materials, weather conditions, fire and other casualties and default by the school, a contractor or subcontractors.  furthermore, the costs of construction, renovation and improvement, as applicable, of the additional improvements to the pr oject facilities may be affected by other factors beyond the control of the borrower or any contractor  constructing, renovating or improving any portion of the project facilities, including those described in the preceding paragraph. environmental risk. length: 4867
