24 authority to file for municipal bankruptcy.  the federal bankruptcy code allows public bodies, such as the village, 
recourse to the protection of a federal court for the purpose of adjusting outstanding indebtedness.80 of the 
local finance law contains specific authorization for any municipality in the state or its emergency control board to file a 
petition under any p rovision of federal bankruptcy law for the composition or adjustment of municipal indebtedness.   
the state has consented that any municipality in the state may file a petition with the united states district court or 
court of bankruptcy under any provisio n of the laws of the united states, now or hereafter in effect, for the composition or 
adjustment of municipal indebtedness.  subject to such state consent, under the united states constitution, congress has 
jurisdiction over such matters and has enacted a mendments to the existing federal bankruptcy statute, being chapter 9 
thereof, generally to the effect and with the purpose of affording municipal corporations, under certain circumstances, with 
easier access to judicially approved adjustment of debt inclu ding judicial control over identifiable and unidentifiable 
creditors.  
the rights of the owners of bonds to receive interest and principal from the village could be adversely affected by the 
restructuring of the village’s debt under chapter 9 o f the federal bankruptcy code.  no assurance can be given that any 
priority of holders of debt obligations issued by the village (including the bonds) to payment from monies retained in any 
debt service fund or from other cash resources would be recognized  if a petition were filed by or on behalf of the village 
under the federal bankruptcy code or pursuant to other subsequently enacted laws relating to creditors’ rights; such monies 
might, under such circumstances, be paid to satisfy the claims of all credi tors generally.  
under the federal bankruptcy code, a petition may be filed in the federal bankruptcy court by a municipality which is 
insolvent or unable to meet its debts as they mature.  the federal bankruptcy code also requires that a plan be filed for 
the adjustment of the municipality’s debt, which may modify or alter the rights of creditors and which could be secured.  if confirmed by the 
bankruptcy court, the plan would be binding upon all creditors affected by it.
