 
security for the series 2014 bonds 
the series 2014 bonds constitute general obligations of the city, and the full faith and credit of the 
city are irrevocably pledged to the payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the series 2014 
bonds. furthermore, the right to enforce payment of the series 2014 bonds 
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and similar laws and equitable 
principles, which may limit the specific enforcement of certain remedies. 
although commonwealth law does not currently authorize such action, future legislation may enable 
the city to file a petition for relief under the united states bankruptcy code (the “bankruptcy code”) if it is 
insolvent or unable to pay its debts.  bankruptcy proceedings by the city could have adverse effects on 
bondholders including, but not limited to (a) delays in the enforcement of their remedies, (b) subordination of 
their claims to claims of those supplying goods and services to the city after the initiation of bankruptcy 
proceedings and to the administrative expenses of bankruptcy proceedings, and (c) imposition without their 
consent of a reorganization plan reducing or delaying payment of the series 2014 bonds. the bankruptcy 
code contains provisions intended to ensure that, in any reorganization plan not accepted by at least a majority 
of a class of creditors such as the holders of general obligation bonds, such creditors will have the benefit of 
their original claims or the “indubitable equivalent” thereof, although such plan may not provide for payment 
of the series 2014 bonds in full. the effect of these and other provisions of the bankruptcy code cannot be 
predicted and may be significantly affected by judicial interpretations.  beneficial owners of series 2014 bonds may wish to take certain steps to 
augment transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the series 2014 bonds, such as 
redemptions, tenders, defaults and proposed amendments to the security documents. length: 2043
