the bonds, like all investment securities, carry a risk of loss of the investment, in whole or in part.  this official statement does not 
purport to describe all of the risks of an investment in the bonds; both the school district and the underwriter disclaim any responsibility 
to advise prospective investors of such risks either as they may exist at the date of dissemination of this official statement or as they may 
appear or change from time to time in the future.  prospective purchasers of the bonds should consult their own legal and tax advisors as to 
the risks associated with an investment in the bonds, their ability bear a loss from an investment in the bonds and the suitability of investing 
in the bonds, in light of their particular, individual, circumstances. 
 
economic factors affecting the financial condition of the school district 
 
changes in current economic conditions, on local, regional and national levels, could adversely affect the school district's operating 
revenues and expenses and, consequently, the school district's ability to pay debt service on the bonds.  among the factors that could have 
such adverse effects are: changes in local demographics; closure or relocation of key industries and employers; increases in local rates of 
unemployment; decreases in the assessed value of real estate within the school district; decreases in real estate tax collections; future contract 
negations with organized labor and the consequent impact on wage scales and operating costs; increasing costs of supplies and materials 
necessary to provide public services; loss or reduction of state and federal subsidies and reimbursements for operating and capital costs; and 
delays in adoption of, failure to budget and appropriate within or other adverse changes to, the commonwealth’s budget, as the same may 
effect school district revenues or the timely payment thereof. 
 
enforcement of remedies 
 
enforcement of a claim for payment of principal of and interest on the bonds may be subject to the provisions of laws enacted by 
the united states or the commonwealth or case law developed by competent courts applying general principles of equity, all of which could 
extend the time for payment or impose other constraints upon enforcement. the trustee may, and upon 
request of the holders of 25% in principal amount of such bonds then outstanding and upon being provided with indemnity satisfactory to it, 
shall, take such action on behalf of the bond purchasers as is more specifically set forth in the act.  (see “security for the bonds -- pennsylvania 
budget adoption and experience”  herein.) 
 
competing commonwealth intercept authorities 
 
 under current pennsylvania law, commonwealth subsidies to school districts can be intercepted for purposes other than to pay debt 
service then due and owing on school district debt. 
 
risk of audit by the internal revenue service 
 
the internal revenue service has an ongoing program of auditing tax-exempt obligations to determine whether, in the view of the 
internal revenue service, interest on such tax-exempt obligations is includible in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income 
tax purposes. length: 3262
