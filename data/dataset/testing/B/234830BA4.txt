 bankruptcy code ("chapter 9").  although chapter 9 provides for the recognition of a security interest represented by a specifically  pledged source of revenues, the pledge of ad valorem taxes in support of a general obligation of a bankrupt entity is not specifically recognized as a security interest under chapter 9.  chapter 9 also includes an automatic stay provision that would prohibit, without bankruptcy court approval, the prosecution of any other legal action by creditors or obli gationholders of an entity which has sought protection under chapter 9.  therefore, should the issuer avail itself of chap ter 9 protection from creditors, the ability to enforce would be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court (which could require that the action be heard in bankruptcy court instead of another federal or state court); and the bankruptcy code provides for broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court in administering any proceeding brought before it. 
possible effects of litigation and changes in law on issuer bonds 
the reform legislation and the changes made by the state legislature to the reform legislation since its enactment did not alter the provisions of chapter 45, texas education code, as  amended, that authorize districts to secure their bonds by pledging the receipts of an unlimited ad valorem debt service tax as security for payment of such bonds (including the bonds).  reference is made, in particular, to the inform ation under the heading "the bonds - security and source for payment". in the future, the legislature could enact additional changes to the finance system which could benefit or be a detriment to a school district depending upon a variety of factors, including the financial strategies that the district has implemented in light of past state funding systems.  while  the disposition of any possible future litigation or the enactment of future legislation to address school funding in texas could substantially adversely affect the financial condition, revenues or operations of the district, as noted herein, the district does not anticipate that the security for payment of the bonds, specifically, the district's obligation to levy an unlimited debt service tax would be adversely affected by any such litigation or legislation. length: 2296
