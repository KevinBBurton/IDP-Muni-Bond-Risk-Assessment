climate change  
the city of quincy has taken significant strides to plan fo r, address, and mitigate the effects of climate change. as storm 
intensities and rising sea levels threaten the capital assets within the city, the city has undertaken several projects aimed 
at addressing the impact of climate change, including subst antial sea wall improvements, flood mitigation through drainage 
improvements, green infrastructure, and the undergrounding of cr itical utilities. multiple drainage projects in every area of the city have added billions of gallons for flooding 
capacity to historically flood-prone areas. of note, the city recently completed kincaide park, which featured extensive 
underground flood prevention measures. these efforts are to enhance th e natural flood prevention that these features offer, and 
include dredging  sediment-laden ponds, improved tidal flood gat e management, combating invasive flora species, nurturing 
and replenishing beaches, and prioritizing tree management. 
 
furthermore, the city actively considers the threat of climate change in financial models and planning efforts. the city has 
conducted a robust review of the effects of climate change on the city, producing a hazard mitigation plan, coastal zone 
management plan, open space plan, and emergency management  plan, among other efforts. through these plans, the 
city identifies and analyzes the financial, economic, and social th reats that climate change poses to the city. cybersecurity 
   the city, like many other large public and private entities, relies on a large and complex technology environment to conduct its operations, including devices, connectivity, servers and software.  as a recipient and provider of personal, private, or sensitive information, the city may be subject to cyber threat s including, but not limited to, hacking, viruses, malware and other attacks on computer and other sensitive digital networks and systems. the city regularly reviews and upgrades  these procedures and protocols to guard against such cyberattacks.   no assurances can be given that the city’s efforts to manage cyber threats and attacks will be successful or  that any such attack will not materially impact the operations or finances of the city.  the quincy contributory retirement system (the “system”) was the subject of a cyber-hack in 2020 involving the use of compromised email credentials to effect a fraudulent transfer of  approximately $3.  the system, in coordination with the city, has implemented improved cybersecurity and financial controls and procedures to prevent similar incidents in the future, including an in-house quality assurance protocol, multi-factor authentication process, and enhanced firewall system.  the city contacted its security contractor and, together with the city’s information technology staff, commenced an inspection of each device with access to the city’s network. length: 3407
