 
  
 notwithstanding such findings, the court did not, however, fashion a remedy, noting the limits of the court’s competency in such 
regards, and writing the court is in “uncharted territory with this landmark case. 
 
enforcement of remedies 
 
enforcement of a claim for payment of principal of and interest on the bonds may be subject to the provisions of laws enacted by 
the united states or the commonwealth or case law developed by competent courts applying general principles of equity, all of which could 
extend the time for payment or impose other constraints upon enforcement. the trustee may, and upon 
request of the holders of 25% in principal amount of such bonds then outstanding and upon being provided with indemnity satisfactory to it, 
shall, take such action on behalf of the bond purchasers as is more specifically set forth in the act.  (see “security for 
the bonds – state intercept  and pennsylvania budget adoption and experience ” herein.) 
 
competing commonwealth intercept authorities 
 
 under current pennsylvania law, commonwealth subsidies to school districts can be intercepted for purposes other than to pay debt 
service then due and owing on school district debt. 
 
cybersecurity 
 
the school district, like many other governmental entities, relies on a technology environment to conduct its operations. as such, 
it may face multiple cybersecurity threats including but not limited to, hacking, viruses, malware and other attacks on computer or other 
sensitive digital systems and networks.  there can be no assurance that any security and operational control measures implemented by the 
school district will be completely successful to guard against and prevent cyber threats and attacks.  the school district maintains 
a cyber-insurance policy.  for pennsylvania school districts, these included the twin fears of 
increased costs of operation, due to mitigation measures, combined with decreased tax revenues and a rise in delinquencies, due to taxpayer 
loss of income. 
 
risk of audit by the internal revenue service 
 
the internal revenue service has an ongoing program of auditing tax-exempt obligations to determine whether, in the view of the 
internal revenue service, interest on such tax-exempt obligations is includible in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income 
tax purposes. 
 
bond insurance risk factors  
 
 in the event of a default in the payment of principal or interest with respect to the bonds when any such payment becomes due, any 
owner of the bonds shall have a claim under the applicable bond insurance policy (the “policy”) for such payment.  to the extent that any payment of principal and interest by the school district in connection with a 
mandatory or optional prepayment of the bonds is recovered by the school district from any owner of the bonds as a voidable preference under 
applicable bankruptcy law, such payments are covered by the policy.  the 
insurer’s financial strength and claims paying ability are predicated upon a number of factors that could change over time. 
 
 the obligations of the insurer under the policy are general obligations of the insurer and, upon an event of default by the insurer, the 
remedies available to the paying agent may be limited by applicable bankruptcy law or other similar laws related to the insolvency of entities like 
the insurer. length: 3388
